    <p>We have generated address for all your transactions. Any money sent to this 
    address will be deposited to your account. Please note, that we wait until we 
    get at least one confirmation of the transaction, so it will take some time for 
    sent bitcoins to appear here. This delay depends on network size and load at 
    this moment.</p>

    <p><strong>You need to come back to this page when you will see confirmations of your
    transaction in order to finalize depositing of Bitcoins.</strong></p>
